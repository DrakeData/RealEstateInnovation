Sylvester is predominantly an agriculture economy, growing peanuts, cotton, corn, pecans and produce.  It is often dubbed the “Peanut Capital of the World” due to our peanut production. Agribusiness is Georgia’s leading industry. The state’s agribusiness as a whole contributes a $56.7 billion impact to the state’s economy and Sylvester and Worth County alone generate $125 million through agriculture-based business. A long-standing Sylvester industry Con-Agra is the manufacturer of Peter Pan peanut butter. All the Peter Pan produced for domestic and international markets is made here in Sylvester.  Consequently, Con-Agra is a major employer for the local workforce, along with the local school system and health services. The Peanut Festival is an annual festival held on the third weekend of October in T.C. Jeffords Park to celebrate the city’s status as Peanut Capital of the World. The event is sponsored by the Sylvester/Worth Chamber of Commerce and ConAgra Foods, makers of Peter Pan peanut butter. Activities include one of the largest parades in the southeast and a beauty pageant with up to 100 contestants. Craftsmen from all over the state come to Sylvester to showcase their creations at the festival.\f",

Marcus & Millichap expressly denies any obligation to conduct a due diligence examination of this Property for Buyer.Any projections, opinions, assumptions or estimates used in this Marketing Brochure are for example only and do not represent the current or future performance of this property.  The value of a net leased property to you depends on factors that should be evaluated by you and your tax, financial and legal advisors.
